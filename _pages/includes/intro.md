# 🙇🏻‍♂️ About me
I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Faculty of Dentistry, The University of Hong Kong (HKU) since 2022. Prior to that, I received my doctoral and master's degrees in Dental Materials Science from HKU, where my research focused on dental materials and digital dentistry. With a background as a materials engineer, I have spent over nine years studying and working in a dental school. My goal is to tackle challenges in dentistry through an engineering approach and contribute to the improvement of dental care quality.
More details about my research can be found [here](/cv/).
